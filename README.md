Hello Githubbers

This is a professional portfolio template that I am creating that will be available for
anyone and everyone to use.

Since this is going to be my first official site that will actually be on a domain, I will
eventually cater it to look much more professional, however for the time being, seeing as how it is currently in just for fun mode, I will be having some fun playing around with it and
tinkering it.

I will do my best to comment everything so that it's nice and easy to understand

Any suggestions are welcome and feel free to fork it for yourself.

Mike
